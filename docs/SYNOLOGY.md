# Running on a Synology NAS (and other small boxes)

Asked in [issue #8](https://github.com/stephenlthorn/auto-identity-remove/issues/8):
does this run on a DS720+ (Celeron J4125, x86_64, 2 GB RAM), and what is the
memory footprint in practice?

**Short answer:** yes, and comfortably - about **250 MB peak** for a full
40-broker run. But nobody had actually tried it before that issue, and three
defects meant it could not have worked. All three are fixed; the numbers below
are measured, not estimated.

## What was broken before this was tested

| | Symptom on a NAS |
|---|---|
| `docker build` aborted | `groupadd: GID '1001' already exists` - the Dockerfile created a user at uid/gid 1001, which the official Playwright base image already uses for `pwuser`. The image never built, for anyone. |
| Browser could not launch | The base image was pinned to Playwright v1.52.0 (ships chromium build 1169) while `npm ci` installed the Playwright client 1.60.0 (needs build 1223). Even with the build fixed, every run died with `Executable doesn't exist at /ms-playwright/chromium-1223/...`. |
| No state was ever saved | Every durable write is tmp-file + `rename()`. `rename()` onto a Docker **single-file** bind mount returns `EBUSY`, and the documented recipe mounted `state.json` exactly that way. Nothing persisted, so each scheduled run re-submitted every broker from scratch. |

`test/docker-build-contract.test.js` and the `docker` job in CI now build the
image and launch a real browser on every push, so this class of failure cannot
ship again silently.

## Measured footprint

Full 40-broker serial run inside the container, using cgroup v2 accounting
(`memory.peak`), not process RSS:

| Configuration | Peak | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Default profile, uncapped | **248.5 MB** | all 40 brokers |
| `AIDR_LOW_MEMORY=1`, hard 700 MB cap | **235.8 MB** | all 40 brokers |
| After launch, before any broker | 140 MB | - |

Memory is **flat across the run** - 236 MB after 10 brokers, 248 MB after 40 - so
there is no page or context leak that compounds over a long run. The tool
processes brokers strictly serially, one page at a time, which is what keeps the
ceiling low.

For contrast: five heavy pages open *simultaneously* peaks at ~1.5 GB. That is
what would OOM a 2 GB box, and it is why this tool stays serial. Do not add
concurrency here without revisiting these numbers.

Image size on disk, `linux/amd64` (the DS720+ architecture): **940 MB**. Most of
that is the Chromium build in the Playwright base image.

So on a 2 GB DS720+, with DSM itself typically using 600-900 MB, a ~250 MB
container leaves real headroom. 2 GB is enough; you do not need the RAM upgrade
for this.

### Caveats on those numbers, stated plainly

- Measured on Docker Desktop 28.0.4, `linux/arm64`. The `linux/amd64` image is
  verified to build and is what a DS720+ runs; Chromium's footprint on amd64 is
  in the same range, but I have not measured it on the J4125 itself.
- The test page is a representative opt-out form plus a 4,000-node DOM and a
  canvas. Real broker pages carry ad and tracker JavaScript and will run higher.
  Budget ~400 MB rather than 250 MB before you consider it tight.
- J4125 is four slow cores. Expect a full run to take noticeably longer than on a
  laptop. It is a monthly unattended job, so that does not matter much.

## Setup on DSM 7 (Container Manager)

### 1. Put the project somewhere on a volume

SSH in (Control Panel → Terminal & SNMP → Enable SSH):

```bash
cd /volume1/docker
git clone https://github.com/stephenlthorn/auto-identity-remove.git
cd auto-identity-remove
```

### 2. Create your config on a machine with a browser

Run `node setup.js` on your laptop, then copy the resulting `config.json` to the
NAS. The wizard is interactive and wants a browser for the account-creation
steps, so it is not a good fit for a headless NAS.

```bash
scp config.json admin@nas.local:/volume1/docker/auto-identity-remove/
```

### 3. Lock down the files

`config.json` holds your legal name, home address, phone and API keys. On a NAS
with family accounts this matters more than on a laptop:

```bash
chmod 600 config.json
touch state.json && chmod 600 state.json
```

The tool now writes both files `0600` itself, but the copy you scp'd in has
whatever mode it arrived with.

### 4. Mount the directory, not individual files

This is the one thing to get right. Mounting `state.json` as a file breaks
atomic writes (`EBUSY`, see above). There is now a fallback that keeps state
working anyway, but it gives up crash-atomicity - so mount the directory and
keep the guarantee:

```bash
docker build -t auto-identity-remove .

docker run --rm --init \
  -e TZ=America/New_York \
  -e AIDR_LOW_MEMORY=1 \
  -v /volume1/docker/auto-identity-remove:/app/data \
  -e AIDR_STATE_PATH=/app/data/state.json \
  --memory=1g \
  auto-identity-remove node watcher.js --dry-run
```

Or with compose, from the project directory:

```bash
TZ=America/New_York AIDR_LOW_MEMORY=1 docker compose run --rm watcher node watcher.js --dry-run
```

Always do a `--dry-run` first. It navigates and confirms the brokers are
reachable without submitting anything.

### 5. Schedule it

Do not use the in-container scheduler on a NAS - use DSM's own. Control Panel →
Task Scheduler → Create → Scheduled Task → User-defined script, monthly on the
1st at 09:00:

```bash
cd /volume1/docker/auto-identity-remove && /usr/local/bin/docker compose run --rm watcher
```

Check the docker path with `which docker` over SSH; DSM has moved it between
versions.

## Settings that matter on a small box

| Setting | Why |
|---|---|
| `AIDR_LOW_MEMORY=1` | Adds `--disable-gpu`, `--no-zygote` and friends. Saved ~13 MB peak in testing - small, but it also cuts background work on slow cores. |
| `TZ=<your zone>` | Containers are UTC. Without this a "1st of the month, 9am" schedule and every report timestamp land in the wrong hour. |
| `--init` / `init: true` | Otherwise node is PID 1, `docker stop` cannot reap the Chromium children, and the state lock is left behind - wedging the next run. |
| `--memory=1g` | Not required (peak is ~250 MB) but it turns a runaway into a container restart instead of DSM killing something else. |
| `shm_size` | The compose file sets 512 MB. Not strictly needed - the code passes `--disable-dev-shm-usage`, so a plain `docker run` with the default 64 MB `/dev/shm` works - but real shared memory is faster. |

## What does not work on a NAS

- **Desktop notifications.** `notify-send` needs a session bus. Use the SMTP
  report (`notify.emailReportTo` in config) or a webhook.
- **iMessage / `osascript` notifications.** macOS only.
- **The interactive `setup.js` wizard.** Some steps want a real browser. Run it
  elsewhere and copy `config.json` over.
- **Headed mode.** There is no display. The tool auto-detects this (Linux with no
  `DISPLAY` → headless) so you do not need to set anything.

## If something goes wrong

```bash
# Is the browser actually launchable in your image?
docker run --rm auto-identity-remove node -e \
  "require('playwright').chromium.launch({headless:true}).then(b=>{console.log('browser OK');return b.close()})"

# Does the image agree with the client about Playwright versions?
docker run --rm auto-identity-remove sh -c 'ls /ms-playwright; node -p "require(\"playwright-core/package.json\").version"'

# Is state actually being written?
docker compose run --rm watcher node -e \
  "const c=require('/app/lib/config');c.recordSuccess('probe','t');c.saveState();console.log('state write OK')"
```

If you have a DS720+ and run this, please report back on
[issue #8](https://github.com/stephenlthorn/auto-identity-remove/issues/8) - real
hardware numbers are better than my emulated ones.
