# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for a security problem.**

Use GitHub's private reporting: **Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability**
on this repository. That creates a private thread visible only to the maintainer.

If private advisories are unavailable to you, open a public issue titled
`security contact request` with no details, and you will be given a private
channel.

Expect a first response within 7 days. This is a spare-time project maintained by
one person, so please be patient rather than escalating publicly.

## What this tool holds, and what a bug can cost

This is not an ordinary utility. `config.json` contains:

- legal name, home address, phone number, date of birth, email address
- optionally: an SMTP password, a CapSolver API key, a HIBP API key, a
  SimpleLogin relay key, and per-broker site credentials

`state.json` contains the complete record of which brokers you have contacted and
when. That record is itself sensitive: it is a list of sites that hold data about
you.

So the bugs that matter most here are the ones that:

1. Move PII somewhere unintended - a log, a snapshot, a report, an error message,
   another local user via file permissions, a third-party site chosen by a remote
   registry rather than by you, or the wrong form field.
2. Submit one person's PII under another person's opt-out request.
3. Report a removal that never happened. The entire output of this tool is "here
   is what was removed"; a false success is worse than a crash, because you stop
   worrying about a listing that is still live.
4. Expose the local dashboard, which serves your config over HTTP.

Reports in those categories are treated as security issues even if they need no
attacker at all.

## In scope

- Anything in the four categories above
- Command or argument injection through config values, feed data, or email content
- SSRF via a URL that came from a remote broker registry or a confirmation email
- Weaknesses in the at-rest encryption (`lib/secrets.js`)
- Dashboard authentication, CSRF, or path-traversal gaps
- Secrets leaking to stdout, `ps`, logs, or the dashboard API

## Out of scope

- Broker sites changing their DOM so a selector stops matching. This is expected
  and continuous; see `STATUS.md`. File it as a normal issue.
- CAPTCHA solving being blocked or failing.
- Rate limiting or bot detection by a broker.
- Anything requiring an attacker who already has your local user account. If they
  can read your home directory, they have `config.json`.
- Dependency advisories with no reachable path in this code. Say which call path
  reaches it and it becomes in scope.

## Hardening you should actually do

```bash
# 1. Encrypt the config at rest. Needs AIDR_PASSPHRASE set when running.
node watcher.js --encrypt-config

# 2. Confirm the PII files are owner-only. The tool writes 0600, but a file you
#    copied in from another machine keeps whatever mode it arrived with.
chmod 600 config.json config.json.enc state.json 2>/dev/null
ls -l config.json state.json

# 3. Use a relay/alias email for submissions rather than your real address.
#    See docs/relay.md.

# 4. Never commit config.json or state.json. Both are gitignored; verify with:
git check-ignore -v config.json state.json
```

If you run the dashboard, keep it bound to localhost and set `AIDR_USER` /
`AIDR_PASS`. On a NAS or shared box, assume anything on the LAN can reach an
unauthenticated port.

## Review process

This codebase was largely written by an AI model, and the review loop initially
used the same model family - which
[issue #8](https://github.com/stephenlthorn/auto-identity-remove/issues/8)
correctly identified as an echo chamber. There is now a cross-model review
requirement for every file that touches PII, crypto, subprocesses or untrusted
network input. See [docs/CROSS_MODEL_REVIEW.md](docs/CROSS_MODEL_REVIEW.md),
including its honest account of what that does and does not buy you.
