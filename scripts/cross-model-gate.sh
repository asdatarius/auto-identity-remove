# Zero-secret CI check for the policy in docs/CROSS_MODEL_REVIEW.md: when a PR
# touches a tier-1 file (PII, crypto, subprocess, untrusted network), the commit
# range must carry a `Cross-model-review:` trailer.
#
# This deliberately does NOT call a model. A public repo gives fork PRs no access
# to secrets, and pull_request_target would mean running with secrets available
# while checking out untrusted head code. So CI checks the paperwork; the model
# call happens locally via `npm run review:cross-model`.
#
# Advisory by default: it annotates and exits 0 unless CROSS_MODEL_STRICT=1, so
# it never blocks a first-time contributor who has not read the policy yet.

::warning::This PR changes tier-1 files but carries no Cross-model-review trailer.

These files touch PII, crypto, subprocesses, or untrusted network input, so the
policy asks for a review by a model from a different family than the one that
wrote the change. Run:

    npm run review:cross-model

then add a trailer to a commit message:

    Cross-model-review: docs/reviews/cross-model/<date>-<sha>.md (P1:0 P2:0)

Or, if it does not apply, say so explicitly:

    Cross-model-review: SKIPPED (<reason>)

Background: docs/CROSS_MODEL_REVIEW.md
