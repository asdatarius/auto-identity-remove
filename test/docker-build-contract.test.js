/**
 * test/docker-build-contract.test.js
 *
 * The pre-existing test/docker.test.js only asserts that the Dockerfile
 * *mentions* certain strings. That is why two build-breaking defects shipped
 * undetected:
 *
 *   1. `groupadd --gid 1001` collided with the `pwuser` account (uid/gid 1001)
 *      that the official Playwright base image already ships, so
 *      `docker build .` failed with "groupadd: GID '1001' already exists".
 *
 *   2. The base image tag (v1.52.0, chromium build 1169) did not match the
 *      playwright version npm actually installs (1.60.0, chromium build 1223),
 *      so even a successful build could not launch a browser:
 *      PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright has no chromium-1223.
 *
 * These tests encode the invariants that would have caught both. They are
 * static checks so they run in milliseconds; .github/workflows/test.yml also
 * performs a real `docker build` plus a browser-launch smoke run, which is the
 * behavioural counterpart to this file.
