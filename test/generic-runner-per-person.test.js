/**
 * test/generic-runner-per-person.test.js
 *
 * Cross-model review finding P1 #3, now fixed properly.
 *
 * The generic pass over ~490 brokers ran ONCE, outside watcher.js's
 * `for (const person of persons)` loop, and filled every form from
 * `activePerson()` = `persons[0]`. State was keyed on the bare broker name with
 * no person component. So for a household config:
 *
 *   - only persons[0] was ever actually submitted to the form-based brokers;
 *   - every other person was left uncovered; and
 *   - the single state entry marked the broker done for all of them, so the next
 *     run skipped it and the report claimed everyone was opted out.
 *
 * Explicit brokers already got this right via stateKey(name, person, count),
 * which produces "Broker|First Last" in multi-person mode. The generic runner now
 * uses the same convention and takes the person to submit as an argument.
 *
 * Cost, stated openly: a multi-person run now does the generic pass once per
 * person, so the wall-clock of an N-person monthly run scales with N. Correct
 * coverage is worth it; silently telling someone their spouse was removed from
 * 490 brokers is not.
